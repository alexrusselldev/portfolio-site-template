## About this template

This functions as a basic portfolio site template.

It is designed to be deployed on Netlify or similar services, and statically generated.

All of the pages and posts are generated from the `mdx` files in the `content` directory.

`mdx` files in the root of the `content` directory correspond to pages. Simply creating a new `mdx` file in this directory is enough to create a new page.
